Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
Register a2 holds 13 in main's call to printf. Register a0 ~ a7 can contain the arguments, it relative to the main function how to implement.

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
Call to function f: 26:	45b1  li	a1,12
Call to function g: 14:	250d  addiw	a0,a0,3

At what address is the function printf located?
Function printf is located on 1528(ra).
It can be calculated by : hex(1528) + 0x30 + 0x0<<12 = 0x5f8 + 0x30 = 0x628.

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
It should be 0x38.

What is the output?
He110 World

The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian.
If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output?
I will set i to 0x00726c64.

Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
No, it is dec change to hex, it not depends on little-endian.

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.)
It will print a random number.

Why does this happen?
Because it does not give the enough arguments to printf function, so printf will get the a2 register in the environment. So, it will depend on what a2 register content.
